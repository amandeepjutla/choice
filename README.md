### Choice: A Nightmare

#### About (Pretentious Version)
This world can be arbitrary and cruel. Every day we're forced to make choices without complete knowledge. All we can do is hope for the best, and often the best is precisely what does not happen. We make mistakes sometimes through no real fault of our own, yet we are punished for them regardless. *Choice* is an exploration of this existential truth in microcosm. It is a game in which you, the player, are asked to make a single bizarre and arbitrary choice. The odds are against you. It is likely that your choice will be wrong. Such is life.

#### About (Blunt Version)
It would be an understatement to say that I'm not a particularly experienced programmer. Still, I wanted a project to work on. I decided that the best way to write a game without giving up in frustration would be to set the most achievable goal possible. Hence, the design of *Choice*, a "game" in which the player presses a single key. Even I could write that. I could, I thought, maybe even come up with some pretentious justification for it. You know - "yeah, this game is arbitrary and frustrating, but, like, that's the point, man - it's just like *life*."

#### Running the Game
Run 'python choice.py' at the command line. The game's written for Python 2.x and it requires the 'curses' module, which is present under OS X and Linux. An unofficial version of 'curses' for Windows seems to be available [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses) and might even work.

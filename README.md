# Choice: A Nightmare

## About (Pretentious Version)
This world can be arbitrary and cruel. Every day we're forced to make choices
without complete knowledge. All we can do is hope for the best, and often the
best is precisely what does not happen. We make mistakes sometimes through no
real fault of our own, yet are punished for them regardless. *Choice* is an
exploration of this existential truth in microcosm. It is a game in which you,
the player, are asked to make a single bizarre and arbitrary choice. The odds
are against you. It is likely that your choice will be wrong. Such is life.

## About (Blunt Version)
When you have no real programming skill, yet want to write a gaame without
giving up in frustration, what do you do? You set an achievable goal. You set,
in fact, the most achievable goal possible. Hence *Choice*, a "game" in which
the player presses a single key. Even I could write that, I thought. I could
even come up with some pretentious justification for it. "Sure, *Choice* might
seem simplistic, but, uh, that's the *point*, man. It's just like *life*."

## Running the Game
Run `python choice.py` at the command line. The game will run in Python 2 or
Python 3. It uses the `curses` module, which is part of the standard library
under macOS or Linux. Under Windows, an unofficial `curses` module seems to be
available [here](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/windows-curses) and might
even work.

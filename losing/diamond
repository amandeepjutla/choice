Yes, the diamond was pretty. Who could blame you, really,
for picking it up? The way it gleamed on the table, its 
cut surfaces sparkling as they caught the flickering light
from the braziers above. You picked it up eagerly, sure 
that it would be of some use. Diamond, after all, is the 
hardest substance there is. You had a vague notion that
the diamond might help you cut your way out of here. Well,
it's been more than sixty hours since you picked that 
diamond up, and you're still scraping it vainly against
the wall. The good news is, you probably will eventually
get out of here if you keep it up. The bad news is, at
this rate it'll take hundreds of years. You don't have 
that much time. In fact, you're weakening already. With
every scrape, your fatigue intensifies. You will die here,
with this diamond in your hand. At least it's pretty.

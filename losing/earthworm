The earthworm wriggles silently on the table. You pick it
up and feel an unfamiliar, though not unwelcome, surge of
affection. The worm is charmingly small and delightfully
pink. It's adorable. It occurs to you that in all your
life, you've never been in love - at least, not until now.
You let the worm crawl onto your hand, and you coo to it
gently. You pet it several times. You decide to give it a
name (after much thought, you come up with 'Wurm'). You
try to teach Wurm tricks, and though your attempts to do
so are resoundingly unsuccessful, your love for Wurm is
anything but diminished. Soon all thought of escape leaves
you entirely - you think only of Wurm now, your beloved
companion. You know that an outside observer would
consider this Wurm thing very weird, but you feel what you
feel. Love is blind. (So are earthworms.)

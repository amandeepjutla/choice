You seize the feather from the table. You're overcome with
elation. Thanks to your time at the academy, you recognize
the feather of a lambent archeoptydon when you see one. 
The legendary, near-extinct bird known for its physics-
defying plumage. Those who don't know better are often 
mystified that a creature as ungainly as the archeoptydon
can fly at all, with its stubby wings and top-heavy
anatomy. The secret, of course, is in the feathers, which
repel gravity itself! With this feather you'll soar to 
safety. Nothing could be simpler. Already you can feel 
it responding to your body heat, becoming lighter and 
tugging you upward. Now your feet are leaving the ground. 
You glance up and notice, for the first time, the braziers
mounted overhead. Too late, you realize you're drifting 
into one. You burn to death. It is unspeakably agonizing.

There are many reasons the magician locked you in this
room, but among them, your absolute lack of common sense
looms largest. An illustrative example: the way you
behaved when you discovered that the grail on the table
was half-filled with a pungent green fluid. Common sense,
had you had it, might have told you that perhaps this
fluid could be dangerous. It might have kept you from
taking the grail in both hands and taking a hearty swig.
Who knows? Had you only had a little common sense, you
might not be in your current predicament, writhing in
agony on the floor and watching powerlessly as the acidic
liquid eats your body from the inside. You are dissolving
more rapidly with every passing second. But take comfort!
When at last you are gone, there will be one fewer person
bumbling through life, making horrible mistakes.

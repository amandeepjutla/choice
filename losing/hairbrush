No one could honestly say that you weren't spoiled for
choice. So much on the table! So many items! You picked
the hairbrush. That's what you went with. You took the 
hairbrush off the table and it probably goes without
saying that you started brushing your hair. Why else would
you have picked it? You were faced with a life-or-death
situation. After seven years of torment as the evil 
magician's increasingly unwilling apprentice, he locked
you in this room and told you that you had one shot at
escape. Well, you're not interested in escape, because
you know what really matters. Sure, you will die here, but
damned if you won't at least die looking good. Each strand
will be in place. They will look upon your corpse in slack
-jawed wonder. Rigor mortis will be setting in, and you'll
be abuzz with flies, but your hair. Such hair.

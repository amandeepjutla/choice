You dip a finger in the inkwell and begin to scrawl a
message across the wall. Your initial intention had been
to scratch out a few words of graffiti, but as you write,
the muse seems to take hold of you. You dip into the
well again and, brow furrowed, you let those few words
become a sentence, then another sentence, then another.
When you've filled an entire wall with print, you move to
another, not even stopping to take a break. You're writing
an epic, a modern myth, with romance, adventure, pathos,
betrayal and drama, leavened, of course, with moments of
light humor. This is your opus, and you were born to write
this. When you have filled all four walls, you start in
on the floor, and soon it, too, is covered with your
prose. When the work is over, so are you. You're exhausted
and your death is at hand. But it was worth it. Right?

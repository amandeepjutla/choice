The jackstone is a small, rounded disc. A trinket, but it
makes you think bitterly of the childhood games you never
learned to play. The academy, and later the magician, had
their own plans for you. Simmering with resentment, you 
resolve to learn right now. Never mind that you have only
the one jackstone, and never mind that you haven't the
faintest idea how to play jacks! Mere details. You'll be
creative, and you'll teach yourself from first principles.
Eagerly, you hunch down in a corner, and fling the
jackstone against the wall. It hits the floor. You pick it
up and fling it against the wall again. It hits the floor.
This is fun. You are having fun. You let out a whoop of 
unbridled joy. This is your lost childhood. You giggle to
yourself and fling the jackstone once again. Your 
childhood may have come back, but your sanity never will.

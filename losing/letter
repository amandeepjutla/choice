The letter is addressed 'to the queen of darkness,' and is
clearly written in the magician's small, spidery hand.
'My queen,' it reads, 'Regarding your recent urgent
request for assistance in locating nourishment for your 
recently-acquired pair of fanged archebeasts, I have found
a specimen that I believe your highness will find quite
satisfactory. You may be amused to learn that the specimen
is in fact human - my (now former) apprentice of nearly
five years, a frankly loathesome individual of whom I was
- to be quite honest - never particularly fond. Sometime,
my highness, I will have to describe to you the opium
incident...truly a low water-mark in my apprentice's short
career. I have placed the specimen in the sealed room, to
which I trust you still have the keys. May your
archebeasts enjoy their meal!' This does not bode well.

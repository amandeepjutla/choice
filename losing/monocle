You hold the monocle to your eye and are astonished to
find that it's not the run-of-the-mill corrective lens
you had expected. Somehow, it's showing you another world
superimposed upon your own! At the academy you heard the
great scholars speculate about higher dimensions. Perhaps
you are seeing into one now? You see several flickering,
iridescent beings, each with several limbs and at least
two heads. Some are large and others - children, perhaps?
- are small. At least twenty of these beings surround you 
in a rough circle. Many are pointing at you, some with 
small boxes, and others with long, ragged fingers. Some
are talking , but with the monocle you can only see, not
hear. You wave an arm to get their attention, to tell them
you are trapped. They seem delighted. Slowly, you realize
the chilling truth: to them, you are an exhibit.

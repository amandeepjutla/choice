When you saw the nail, you saw a solution. A way out. Not
a literal way out, admittedly, but an exit. The fact is,
you've never exactly enjoyed life. Your memories begin
with the academy - you might as well have been born within
its towering walls. Years of your life were lost to
monotonous study - and you were never quite good enough
for them, were you? No wonder you agreed so readily when
the evil magician made his offer. Anything to get away 
from those windbags. Yet somehow - irony of ironies - life
with the magician was even worse! He belittled you at
every turn, treated you like a servant. Now he wanted to
get rid of you. Well, maybe he would be rid of you, but at
least - with the nail's help - it could happen on your own
terms. Yet as you drove the nail through your own chest, 
you wondered: were you playing into his hands after all?

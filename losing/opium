You don't doubt that the magician put each item here very
deliberately. The opium cannot possibly be here for any
reason except to mock you. He remembers the opium incident
as well as you. It was shameful. Yet, in your defense, how
were you to have known that it would have such a powerful
effect on you? How were you to have predicted what you
would do under its influence, staggering about the
magician's study in your narcotized haze? You hadn't meant
to break so many things. But the magician never let you
forget it. 'Remember the opium incident?' he'd ask you,
apropos of nothing. 'Have I ever,' he'd ask a mutual
acquaintance, 'told you about the opium incident?' And now
he'd put a vessel of opium here on this table. In a fit of
pique, you smash it to the ground. As it explodes, you
learn - too late - that it didn't contain opium after all.

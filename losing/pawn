The pawn is wooden, carved in the Staunton style. It feels
good in your hand. You run a finger along its head and 
think wistfully of your long-gone, chess-playing youth.
Those games on the academy grounds, under the sycamores,
comprised some of the most thrilling moments of your life.
(You haven't had the most eventful life.) You won more
games than you lost. People said you were a natural. They
said you were making a terrible mistake by apprenticing
yourself to that evil magician. Under the circumstances,
you have to admit that maybe they were right. Oh, if only
you could go back and become the chess champion you were
rightfully meant to be! But that's never going to happen. 
Instead you will spend the rest of your life right here,
trapped in this room, sobbing as you cradle this pawn, 
this reminder of what could have been.

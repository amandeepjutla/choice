You examine the rebus carefully. You see a willow tree
within an ellipse, next to which is an eye. Below the eye
are three salamanders. Next to them is a wolf, howling at
an oven mitt which holds the handle of a broom sweeping
the floor of a lake. Three fish are leaping from the lake,
and nearby is a sickle. Below that is a blade of grass on
which a miniature moose stands. There is (much) more, but 
you cannot go on. Trying to parse what little of the rebus
you've looked at has made your head throb ominously. The 
world around you is exploding into scintillating points 
of light, and there's a rushing in your ears. You had your
last migraine when you were at the academy. It landed you
in the sick ward for weeks. You remember the clinician who
stood sentinel. What had he said? What unusual severity. 
You won't survive another one of these. He was correct.

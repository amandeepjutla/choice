The scarf is long, made from knitted wool. You stretch it
gently with both hands, and are pleased to find that its
tensile strength seems more than adequate for your daring
escape. You tie a thick knot in one end and toss it into
the air. You watch it loop around the arm of one of the
wall-mounted braziers overhead and fall to the floor. So
far, so good. You pick up the knot, tie it to the other
end of the scarf, and give it an experimental tug. If all
goes well, the brazier and the scarf will hold your weight
and you'll be able to climb out of here. But all does not
go well. Ten feet off the ground, the scarf rips. You let
go of the rapidly-weakening fabric and lunge for the 
brazier just above you. You miss. You survive the fall, 
but your spine and your resolve have both been shattered. 
You'll never move again. So much for tensile strength.

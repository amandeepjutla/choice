Ever since the opium incident, you've been missing a 
tooth - your left maxillary central incisor, to be exact.
It just so happens that exactly this tooth happens to be
lying on the table. A warier person than you might have 
seen this as suspicious. You, on the other hand, grab the
tooth, open your mouth, and push it into its socket. You
know, not everyone would have done that, necessarily. Not
to discount your decision at all. Just pointing that out.
Anyway, at first it's great. The new tooth fits. In fact, 
it's getting tighter by the moment. You feel a stab of 
pain in your mouth as the tooth begins to grow, forcing 
its way backwards into your gum tissue, which is 
solidifying and enamelizing. You reach into your mouth, 
and as your fingers touch the tooth, they harden too. 
Moments later, when your body hits the floor, it shatters.

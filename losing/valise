Inside the valise you find a map of the magician's domain,
with points of interest helpfully circled in red. Perhaps
most relevantly for your situation, you notice an area
marked 'sealed room,' located south of the library and
east of the sun parlor. How can it be that in all your
years of living on the magician's grounds, you'd never
seen any evidence that this place existed? Your question
is answered by a small book under the map, a grotesque
parody of a tourists' guidebook written, you assume, by
the magician himself - you'd know his cruel sense of humor
anywhere. 'The sealed room,' says the guidebook, 'is a 
marvellous feat of engineering, an enclosure one can enter
but never - except under extraordinary circumstances - 
leave. Typically it serves as an execution chamber of
sorts for unsatisfying apprentices.' You close the book.

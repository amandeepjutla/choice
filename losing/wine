The wine bottle catches your eye. The label advertises a
pinot noir from the year 315 - a good vintage. It's been a
while since you had a really fine drink. To be left in a
room to die like this is taxing to your nerves, and a sip
of the pinot seems, increasingly, like an excellent idea.
So you pick up the bottle and reach for a corkscrew, only
to find that there isn't one. No matter - you'll open this
thing up yourself. Steadying the bottle with one hand, you
wrap the other around the cork and twist. The cork doesn't
budge. Perhaps you need more of a grip. You hunch over the
table, bite down on the cork with your teeth, and swivel
the bottle with both hands. A few hours later, your mouth
is bleeding, your jaw is shattered, and most of your teeth
are missing, but the bottle is open. Victory! You take a 
celebratory sip of the wine. It tastes sort of all right.

Soon after picking up the diamond you hear a strange pop
from behind. You turn around and are face-to-face with a
diminutive man wearing a fez and a set of robes far longer
than he is tall. When you ask who he is, he laughs softly,
as though amused that you don't already know. 'I'm the 
jewel master,' he says. 'When I smell a jewel, I come 
a-poppin'. May I see that?' You hesitate. He looks hurt. 
'I'm not a thief,' he says. 'I just want to appraise it.' 
Reluctantly you hand the diamond over. For several minutes
the jewel master squints at it through a loupe. 'What do
you want in return for this?' he asks. 'It's worth at 
least a thousand metasplints.' You tell him that, all 
things considered, you'd rather have safe passage out of
here than any number of metasplints. He is unimpressed, 
but complies. You are free...but poor.

The earthworm, at your touch, begins to grow. You take a
step back and watch, amazed, as it expands massively in
both length and girth. It dives into the floor and begins
to chew. You grab its flank and hold on tightly as you're
dragged underground, through a wormhole in the making. You
soon break through into a vast cavern through which the
worm floats, somehow defying gravity. Other giant worms
sail past in all directions. They call to one another in
sonorous tones. You are overwhelmed by the beauty of worm
society. For the next thirty years of your life, you live
among them, learning wormsong and wormspeech, immersing
yourself in wormfolkways. Although you yourself are not,
and could never be, a worm in body - a fact which causes 
you great anguish in your heart - you are a worm in mind
and a worm in spirit, and a worm you shall always be.

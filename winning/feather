As you lift the feather from the table you feel a tingling
in the fingers of one hand that spreads to the other. The
tingling intensifies into a strong itch that travels up
both your arms. You look down and are shocked to find that
new feathers are sprouting from your skin. Experimentally,
you try flapping, and at once you rise into the air,
soaring higher and higher. You burst through the ceiling
of the sealed room and are awash in cool fresh air. Below
you the magician's domain dwindles into a model of itself.
Up you go, beyond the birds, past the drakes, into and 
above the clouds. Soon the curvature of the horizon
becomes apparent. You're above the atmosphere itself. The
world seems minor, its concerns petty. It is beneath you,
in more ways than one. As you speed away from it, you know
you will never return. The infinite void is your home now.

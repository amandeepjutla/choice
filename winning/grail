The grail is so heavy that it's difficult for you to lift
it. You have to use both hands, and even then it takes all
your strength - you tremble, holding it up. Understanding
that the grail's weight could work to your advantage, you
stagger away from the table and let the grail fall. Just
as you suspected, the grail crashes through the floor.
You jump into the hole it has made and land next to the 
corpse of a monster. The grail must have killed this 
creature when it fell. While you're still considering the
implications of this, you hear footsteps. Monsters are 
surrounding you. You panic. Will they demand vengeance? 
No, they're pleased! You killed a tyrant, and according to
the monster code, you are their new ruler! You accept this
honor and usher in an age of enlightenment. Your rule is 
kind yet just. You have the grail and know when to use it.

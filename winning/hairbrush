You pick up the hairbrush. You use it. Now you look -
there's no other way to put this - fabulous. In fact, this
is, with respect to fabulousness, easily your all-time
high. It might even be a high for the human race in
general. If not, it's certainly close. The magician, to
his credit, seems to recognize this, because, mere seconds
after you've used the hairbrush to enact your fabulous
transformation into a very good-looking person, the
magician has spirited you out of the enclosed room and
into his study. 'I'm so sorry,' he says, 'to have done
something so horrible to someone so fabulous.' You decide
not to forgive him, because why should you, and his life
soon ends in a suicide that's nearly as fabulous as you
are. You return to the academy where you grew up and are
awarded an honorary degree in hairbrush theory.

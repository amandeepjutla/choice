You lift the inkwell and take a refreshing sip of ink.
It's got to be some of the best ink you've ever tasted.
It's lean and austre, yet with a tart bite. The texture is
smooth and a bit nutty, with a clean, herbaceous sense of
leafiness. You're struck by its rustic body, which is
velvety in a delicate sort of way. There's so much
complexity and density here. What a finish! What grip! The
pruny aeration is aggressive, yes, but all that means is
that this ink has backbone. In its flowery way, it's 
quite harmonious. You take another lingering sip, swishing
the ink around in your mouth a bit, trying to really savor
the taste. An elegant ink. Balanced. Graceful. 'If beauty
has a flavor,' you murmur, 'surely this is it.' Another
sip and the enclosed room melts away. You're in ink
country now. Eagerly, you run off to tend the inkyards.

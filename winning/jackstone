As you reach for the jackstone, the magician materializes
and takes it away before you can touch it. 'Sorry,' he
says. 'I didn't mean to leave this here.' You are
skeptical. Didn't mean to? Surely not. Everything the 
magician has ever done, for better or for worse, has been
very deliberate. You've never known him to make mistakes. 
Besides, you heard the spiel he gave when he took you 
here. Seventeen things, he'd said. A specific number that
included the jackstone, did it not? As the magician 
listens to all this he looks increasingly flustered. 
'Look,' he says, 'everyone makes mistakes. Myself 
included. I really meant sixteen things, I swear. This
jackstone is off the table, literally, okay? All right, I
can tell you're not satisfied. As a show of good faith,
why don't I just call this whole thing off?' He does.

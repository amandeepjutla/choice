'Dear valued customer,' reads the letter, 'congratulations
on having been chosen to be the recipient of our grand
prize. Not everyone wins, but you did. You should be proud
of yourself. Our representatives will arrive to present
you with your well-earned award momentarily.' Stunned, you
put the letter down and begin racking your brains,
wondering what on earth you could have done to deserve
such an honor. It's not long before three robed figures
materialize across the table from you. The middle figure
booms, 'Ah - the winner,' and the ones flanking it begin
to clap excitedly. 'Your mentor the magician recommended
you for this prize,' says the middle figure. 'An all-
expenses paid trip to FrogLand!' The figure snaps its 
fingers and you're spirited away, to the froggiest
amusement park in the world. You could die of bliss.

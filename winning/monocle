You never thought you needed corrective eyewear. That was
before you tried the monocle. Through its lens, the world
looks amazingly sharp. It's like you're seeing it for the
first time. As you look around the room, nearly in tears
from the joy of sight, the magician blinks into existence
and pats you on the shoulder. 'I should have realized,'
he said, 'that you weren't stupid after all - you were
just astigmatic. All those years I wondered why you
never understood what I tried to teach you. You probably
couldn't even read any of the scrolls, huh? Come on.
Let's put an end to this charade.' The magician resumes
tutoring you in earnest. In thirty short years, you've
learned all the evil he could teach, and when at last he
dies of old age, you're a worthy successor: the most 
powerful, evil, and astigmatic magician who lived.

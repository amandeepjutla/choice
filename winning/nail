Some interesting facts about the nail: 1) it's very, very
sharp, 2) it's at least a foot long, 3) it's unbelievably
rusty. It's a good thing you paid attention at the 
academy - you know what rusty nails can do. It is without
hesitation, then, that you remove your right shoe and
plunge the nail into the flesh of your foot. The magician,
hearing your subsequent screams, pops into the room and
demands to know what happened. You tell him you somehow
stepped on the nail, it was definitely an accident, and
now you're worried that you might have tetanus. The
magician takes you to a doctor who confirms the diagnosis.
You spend the short remainder of your life in a hospital
bed, slowly dying, but on the bright side the magician is
held liable for your fate and is executed. Fatal illness
notwithstanding, you have clearly triumphed here.

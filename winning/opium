With the vessel of opium, you reason, you can wrap
yourself in the loving arms of Morpheus and escape to the
twilight world of dreams, et cetera. And so you do. You
give yourself the whole vessel - enough to slow your rate
of breathing to barely more than that of a corpse - and
you sink peacefully into dreams. You leap across moonbeams
to distant planets, where you skip across oceans and float
through azure skies. You visit Xanadu, and Shangri-La. You
witness your own life, death, and afterlife. You 
experience the birth and death of the universe. You come 
to know the minds of all the gods, and even become one 
yourself. You invade the mind of the magician, and seed it
with madness. You live in his dreams until the end of his 
days and even beyond, haunting him forever. He regrets
locking you in that room, but for him it is far too late.

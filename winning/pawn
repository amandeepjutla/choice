You reach for the pawn, but it climbs off the table and
escapes your grasp. It scutters to the corner of the room.
You follow it and there you find the Lady of Chess
herself, resplendent in her suit of chessarmor, with her
legendary chessword at her side. The pawn has perched on
her shoulder, like a timid bird. The lady challenges you
to a game. Figuring you have nothing to lose, you accept.
You are taken to her chessestate, where you face each 
other across an exquisite marble chessboard. She is white
and you are black. She is missing a piece; the pawn on her
shoulder. You point this out to her, and she simply shrugs.
The game is on. Two hours later you have her in checkmate.
You tell her that perhaps, had she had her full complement
of pieces, she would have won. She thanks you for your
kindness, but insists that you've won. The pawn is yours.

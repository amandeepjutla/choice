The rebus puzzles you initially. Its symbols seem at best
rather arbitrary and at worst entirely meaningless. But
in a sudden flash of insight, your incomprehension gives
way to understanding! The rebus contains nothing less than
the secret to life itself. For so long your professors at
the academy had worked to discover a grand unified theory
without succeeding. But now you realize that everything
about reality is basically a farse, an illusion. No prison
can hold you. Confidently you stride out of the enclosed
room, and you do it without even physically walking. You
don't need to walk when you can travel between two points
just by thinking. The arrow of time means nothing to you
either. You take a short trip into the past and prevent
the magician's parents from ever conceiving. Not only is
he no longer a menace, he never was.

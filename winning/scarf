You wrap the scarf around your neck and, as if to justify
what you've just done, the room decides to become very
cold. Cause and effect have seemingly reversed themselves.
You approach a wall and punch it, and because you never
would have done such a thing had the wall not been soft
and trivially easy to punch to, that's exactly what the
wall becomes. You travel to the magician's study and tell
him his life is over. Even though it isn't, because you
told him so, the universe seems to decide it must be true
and he drops dead. You walk to the nearby village and in
the general store you buy everything in sight. You're
spending money you don't have, so you must have it, and
you do. You're hungry, so you crack open a raw egg and
begin eating it as if it's cooked, and it turns out that
it is. You begin acting like you rule the world. You do.

The tooth is hook-shaped, and it was taken, you are sure,
to a hooktoothed thinskinned glinter. Well, think of the
devil - a glinter missing its right hooktooth approaches
you and growls. You tell it you'll give it the tooth if it
helps you kill a certain person who locked you in a 
certain enclosed room - viz., this one. The glinter, eager
for blood (because, like all glinters, it's deeply, deeply
carnivorous) says it's a deal. Together you approach the
magician, who's fallen asleep again watching his crystal
ball, and give him a tap on the back. He only makes it
halfway to consciousness before the glinter has swallowed
the entire top half of his body and is well on its way to
polishing off the second half. You give the glinter back
its tooth and it gleefully bounds away, thanking you
profusely. You turn to the crystal ball to see what's on.

You open the valise. Inside, to your surprise, you find
not the mundane travel supplies you were expecting but
a very welcome portal to another world. You pass through
without hesitation - anything to get out of the magician's
clutches! On the other side is an unusual world indeed, a
place where the trees grow out of the sky and into the
ground, where the sun is a triangle of pulsing green,
where the people have no limbs but Brobdingnagian heads,
where the flowers are carnivorous and can chase their prey
faster than the speed of sound. You are impressed and
bewildered. You'll integrate yourself into society as best
as you can. You'll never pass as a person - your head is
just too small - but you figure you could hack it as a
flower. And so you do, basking in the green light of the 
savannah, snacking on the occasional bigheaded interloper.

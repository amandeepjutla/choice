You're very glad to see the wine bottle. It means you have
something to write with. You dip a finger in the bottle
and get started writing a message on the table's surface.
You're just getting into it when you feel a tap on your
shoulder. A woman stands nearby, eyes narrowed. 'Excuse
me,' she says. 'I'm the arbiter, and I decide what's 
appropriate and what's not. What you're doing right now is
really inappropriate.' You ask what she means. 'You're 
writing with wine,' she says patiently. 'That's what ink 
is for. What were you thinking?' You apologize and put the
bottle back down. The arbiter says your apology is a start
but by itself it's not enough. You need re-education. With
her you leave the room, and she takes you back to the
academy. You repeat all your classes, but this time you
pay more attention, and you learn what wine is for.
